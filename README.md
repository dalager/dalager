## Hi, I'm Christian Dalager 👋

## I'm working as a Consultant / Software Engineer / Hands-on Architect at [Eksponent ApS](https://eksponent.com)

This, though, is my private collection of public repositories -- a wide range of source code artifacts of varying completeness, meningfulness and age in C#, Python, JavaScript and Ruby.

I'm interested in applied technology and like to explore the possible applications of new tech. 

Some times it silly and serves only as a what-can-I-do-with-this playground.
